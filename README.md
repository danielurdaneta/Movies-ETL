# Movies-ETL

## Overview of the project

In this project we create a code that make the ETL process: **extract** data from csv and json files, **transform** , remove columns with little or no information, reformat, change data type and cleaning the data in general, and **load** the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database ready to query and get information, we did it using Python, Pandas and PostgreSQL.

You can find the jupyter notebooks that contains all the code we used as the csv and json files.
